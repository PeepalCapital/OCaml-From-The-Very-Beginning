(* This is a comment *)
(* Reminds me of Common Lisp :/ *)
(* I don't like the double semi-colons ;; The parentheses of Common Lisp is beautiful *)

(* In the REPL called UTOP to break or interrupt we need to use Control + C *)
(* The REPL seems irritating compared to Common Lisp's SLIME *)

(* Both OCaml and Common Lisp are a pain to install and get running. No match for Python! *)
